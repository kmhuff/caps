# caps

Utilities for saving and viewing caps (from captions), collections of images and text.

Caps could include, for example:
* A single image (all common types of image and video)
* A single txt file
* A zip file containing only a single image and a single txt file (a caption)
* A zip file containing a sequence of images, txt files, and/or captions (an album)

Save caps with save_caps.py, view them with view_caps.py. See the help options of the individual utilities for more.
